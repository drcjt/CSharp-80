	<h4>What is this?</h4>
	The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 Model III</a> is an old 8-bit home computer.  This web page emulates it using only Javascript.
	<p>
	You'll need a web browser with a fast Javascript engine.  The latest (mid 2010) versions
	of Chrome, Safari and Opera will work well on a reasonably fast machine (2 GHz processor)
	Firefox will run, but not real-time, and IE is very slow (both should get faster within a year or so).
	<p>
	Click on the Run button to start the BASIC interpreter.  You will need to press ENTER
	twice to get the actual BASIC ready prompt.
	<p>You can also try out a few other programs by selecting them in the table above.
	Note that the backslash (\) key is the TRS-80 clear key, needed to start <em>Super Nova</em>.
	<p>Oh, and, sorry in advance, the backspace button won't leave the page because
	it is too useful for deleting characters.  In fact, most short-cut keys won't work
	as the emulator needs to intercept most key presses.
	<h4>Technical Details</h4>
	This emulator is really a testament to the extreme speed of modern computers and
	the astounding new Javascript interpreters.  The combination can easily emulate
	the function of the <span style="white-space: nowrap">TRS-80</span> running at 2 MHz.  That's well over 100,000 emulated instructions
	per second!
	<p>The code here came from converting the C code my <a href="http://www.48k.ca/">twin brother</a>
	wrote for trs80gp into Javascript.  That would have been easy except that he used
	features of C (like pointers) and I had to spend some time undoing all that cleverness.
	<p>Most <span style="white-space: nowrap">TRS-80</span> games had sound effects
	by using the cassette port.  But this emulator doesn't have any sound effects
	because I don't know of a portable way to play dynamically generated sound in Javascript.
	<p>I haven't spent a great deal of time testing it although I've ran about a dozen
	different programs with no noticable problems.
	<p>It was a hassle to get the emulator running on a selection of browsers.
	Some didn't support the &lt;canvas&gt; tag (IE and Opera) and the workaround version
	using <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites">CSS sprites</a> required
	a horrific amount of fiddling.  There's a bit of VBScript in here to allow IE to load
	binary data using AJAX.  And, finally, the key codes generated varies a bit from
	browser to browser.  I could have used JQuery or some other library but doing it
	by myself was educational.  (Although I'll admit I haven't tried to cover a very
	wide range of browsers at all).  At one point the emulator did function using
	Opera for the Wii and the PS3's internal browser--but far too slow to be usable.
	Owners of iPads or iPhone 3GS or better should be able to get the Cass? prompt
	going, again, a bit slowly.
	<p>About the keyboard.  The original <span style="white-space: nowrap">TRS-80</span> keyboard is somewhat different
	from contemporary PC keyboards and does not support as many keys.  The emulator tries to
	map the key you press to the appropriate <span style="white-space: nowrap">TRS-80</span> combination.
	The old BREAK key is available by typing ESC and the CLEAR key is available via backslash.

	Here's the original keyboard layout with the shift keys.
	(Assuming you have a PC keyboard--but it should work pretty similar on a Macintosh)
<pre>
TRS-80 keyboard layout
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  :  -  BK
 up Q  W  E  R  T  Y  U  I  O  P  @  lf rt
  dn A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  ;  EN CL
   sh Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  ,  .  / sh
           S P A C E B A R

Holding shift:

!  "  #  $  %  &amp;  '  (  )  0<sup>1</sup> *  =  BK
 up Q  W  E  R  T  Y  U  I  O  P  `  lf rt<sup>2</sup>
  dn A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  +  EN CL
   sh Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  &lt;  &gt;  ? sh
           S P A C E B A R

</pre>
	Notes:
	<ol>
	<li>Shift-Zero toggles between upper case only/lower case input.  Use underscore
	on your keyboard to get this function.
	<li>Shift-right arrow switches to 32 character wide mode.
	</ol>

	<h4>Use it on your own web page</h4>
	Go ahead and put a <span style="white-space: nowrap">TRS-80</span> on your own webpage!
	You'll need to copy the Javascript and some PNG files:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="trsemu-1.4.js">trsemu-1.4.js</a></li>
	<li><a href="tx/m3.png">tx/m3.png</a></li>
	<li><a href="tx/wdot.png">tx/wdot.png</a></li>
	<li><a href="tx/red.png">tx/red.png</a></li>
	<li><a href="tx/grn.png">tx/grn.png</a></li>
	</ul>
	A minimal page would look like the following.  The performance graph
	is optional; drop the '.perf()' call if you don't want it.
	<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="trsemu-1.4.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body
onload="trsEmu.screen('scrn').button('btn').perf('graph').focus();"&gt; 
&lt;div id="scrn"&gt;
&lt;canvas width="512" height="384" style="background:black"&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id="graph"&gt;
&lt;canvas width="512" height="100" style="background:black"&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type="button"id="btn" value="Run"
  onClick="trsEmu.run('toggle');"&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Reset"
  onClick="trsEmu.run('reset');"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	</pre>
	Multiple emulators can be created on a page.  Use <em>trsEmu.mknew()</em> to create
	a new emulator and then give it its own <em>.screen()</em>.  You will have to deal
	with the focus, perhaps via an <em>onclick</em> callback.
	<p>
	Run binaries with the <em>trsEmu.run()</em> command. Just pass it a URL fragment
	and it will load the executable from your site using AJAX. It supports the .cmd,
	.hex (zmac output), .3bn (system tapes) and .bas formats.  The .bas format is
	just an ASCII text version of a BASIC program.
	<p>
	Version 1.3 added support for the .cas cassette tape format and binary basic programs.
	<p>
	The <em>.run()</em> command also works as a macros if the string contains one
	of the |, [] or {} characters.  Here are the meanings (and look at this
	page for examples):
	<ul>
	<li><b>|</b> resets the machine.
	<li><b>{filename}</b> loads filename into memory (and executes if binary)
	<li><b>[count]</b> delays for <em>count</em> frames.
	<li><b>~</b> is ignored but forces macro mode.
	<li>other characters are typed literally to the keyboard.
	</ul>	
	For example, the following statement will reset, load <em>foo.bas</em>, and run it:
	<pre>trsemu.run("|[1]_\r0\r[1]{foo.bas}RUN\r")</pre>
	(Which, BTW, is done automatically when run is passed a string ending in .bas).	
	<h4>That's all</h4>
